# Pretty Image Loader

Strip loading tool for the Blender video editor (sequencer). This Blender addon loads prettier images and movies with transparency and original image dimensions instead of default settings and wonkily stretched/squashed dimensions.

## Getting Started

Here's one way to get this add-on working in your local Blender:
- download, fork or clone this repo into a new folder in Blender's `scripts/addon_contrib`
- start Blender
- open `User Preferences`
- select `Add-ons`
- filter the support level to `Testing`
- enable the Pretty Image Loader

## Origins

This addon began life as a single script in my general [Blender anim customizations](https://github.com/Botmasher/blender-vse-customizations) repo. After using it for multiple videos and addressing a relevant issue opened for that repo, it was time to single this out and pull it into its own package. The original script is now deprecated; this is the place for future development.

## Contributing

Glad to have more help! The [remarks about contributions](https://github.com/Botmasher/blender-vse-customizations/blob/master/README.md#contributing) for my anim projects apply to this addon.
